# Develop-an-end-to-end-Machine-Learning-Pipeline
This repository contains my project on Python Labs for Machine Learning course's taught by Professor Hanna Abi-Akl in 2023.
In this project we will analyse the Goodreads-books dataset and train a model that predicts a bookâ€™s rating.

## Prerequisites

The preliminary step consists in installing the Python interpreter on your computer.

### Download The Installer

This project has been tested with Python 3.11.5, Jupyter Notebook 7.0.6, pandas 2.1.4, numpy 1.26.3, matplotlib 3.8.0, seaborn 0.12.2 and scikit-learn 1.2.2

## Demarrage

To explore this project please download the 2 datasets and the python notebooks.
You have the option to upload the files via Jupyter notebook, which will conveniently relocate them to the current working directory of your Python installation. Alternatively, you can manually place the files in the current working directory and subsequently execute the notebooks.
